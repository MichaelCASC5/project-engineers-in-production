    "Description": "Many years ago when I first discovered computer science and programming, I gained the ability to create virtually anything, only limited by what I could learn myself. Since then, I've found myself coding and building programs in as much freetime as I could afford; I grew an an incessant urge to expand my technological ability in this endless fire to continue to work to build greater and greater things. That is now what I am here for. I want to put my yearning to create into building the future, and this website marks my first steps into the real world of computer science.",

I've been doing it for about 8 years, and I don't think I'm going to stop anytime soon. I hope that one day I'll be able to put my 3D skills to the test!"
