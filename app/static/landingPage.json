    "Description": "When I was small, I discovered my urge to want to build and create, but I always found myself limited in terms of physical resources and ability. In middle school, once I discovered computer science and programming, I gained the ability to create virtually anything, only limited by what I could learn myself. Since then, I've found myself coding and building programs in as much freetime as I could afford; I grew an an incessant urge to expand my technological ability in this endless fire to continue to work to build greater and greater things.",
