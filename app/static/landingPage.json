    "Description": "When I was small, I discovered my urge to want to build and create, but I always found myself limited in terms of physical resources and ability. In middle school, once I discovered computer science and programming, I gained the ability to create virtually anything, only limited by what I could learn myself. Since then, I've found myself coding and building programs in as much freetime as I could afford; I grew an an incessant urge to expand my technological ability in this endless fire to continue to work to build greater and greater things. At the moment, I'm a computer science major at Hunter College. It was about halfway through high school did I realize that computer science wasn't something I could just do for myself, to build things just for myself, but I could build things for people. I could help build the future. After moving on from AP Computer Science, and after investing many summers and winters in coding-related intensives and extracirriculars, I chose my major for the reason that I'd be able to continue doing computer science far into the future.",
